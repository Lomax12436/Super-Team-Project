# Super-Team-Project
This group project was to create a functional application using two server side APIs as well as a CSS framework that was not Bootstrap. Our team decided to develop a Dungeons and Dragons character generator.

# What is the purpose of this generator?
the purpose behind this generator is to create a faster, more streamlined method of generating or creating a DnD character so that way you can spend more time playing your next campaign instead of developing and writing characters from scratch.
It offers two methods of creation:
 - One is a random generator that will create a character for you based on the most current (5th Edition) DnD classes, races, etc. 
 - The other is a template in order to build your chracter based off of the same information, but with the ability to customize user selection and inputs.

 # How does it work?
 After navigating to the home page, you will select whether you would like to generate a random character or build your own. The user will select the choice the would like, and be directed to the corresponding page. 
When the user accesses the new page, they can select from, a variety of options contained in drop down menus, or they can select the 'Randomize' button and generate a random character within those same parameters. They may also change individual items within the randmomized chracter if they do not like a certain attribute that was generated.
