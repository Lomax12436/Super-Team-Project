# Super-Team-Project
This group project was to create a functional application using two server side APIs as well as a CSS framework that was not Bootstrap. Our team decided to develop a Dungeons and Dragons character generator.

# What is the purpose of this generator?
the purpose behind this generator is to create a faster, more streamlined method of generating or creating a DnD character so that way you can spend more time playing your next campaign instead of developing and writing characters from scratch.
It offers two methods of creation:
 - One is a random generator that will create a character for you based on the most current (5th Edition) DnD classes, races, etc. 
 - The other is a template in order to build your chracter based off of the same information, but with the ability to customize user selection and inputs.

 # How does it work?
 After navigating to the home page, you will select whether you would like to generate a random character or build your own. The user will select the choice the would like, and be directed to the corresponding page. 
 For example, if the user selects the 'Build Your Own' button, they will be directed to the character builder, where all options will be divided based on content and arrranged into a dropdown list to select from.
 Meanwhile, if the 'Generate Character' button is selected, the user will be redirected to a page with a randomly generated DnD character with necessary attributes as well as a name.
