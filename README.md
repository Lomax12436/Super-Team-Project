# Super-Team-Project
This group project was to create a functional application using two server side APIs as well as a CSS framework that was not Bootstrap. Our team decided to develop a Dungeons and Dragons character generator.

# What is the purpose of this generator?
the purpose behind this generator is to create a faster, more streamlined method of generating or creating a DnD character so that way you can spend more time playing your next campaign instead of developing and writing characters from scratch.
It offers two methods of creation:
 - One is a random generator that will create a character for you based on the most current (5th Edition) DnD classes, races, etc. 

 # How does it work?
 After navigating to the home page, you will select the button to generate a random character. The user will select the 'Generate Character' button.
When the user accesses the new page, they will select the 'Randomize' button and generate a random character within parameters set by the 5th Edition of Dungeons and Dragons.

# WHat is the purpose of this project?
The purpose of thius challenge was to not only show an understanding of the material that has been covered so far in the bootcamp, but to also dmeonstrate what collaborating with a team in order to work on a group project would look like in the real world.
